## Overview
Tired of hearing friends and co-workers endlessly postulate on the benefits of the Keto diet, I developed this joke site to expound the virtues of simply eating less.

## Demo
[KenoDiet.com](http://www.kenodiet.com/)

## Features
- None, really

## Development Philosophy
The key to developing this website was to build it quickly. It doesn't incorporate any framework or libraries, but rather relies solely on plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In total, around 30 minutes of development time went into its creation, testing, and deployment. Since it's a throw-away website, I wanted to focus on comedy, making the color palette as hideous as possible, and the code itself reminiscent of a Web 1.0 site from the mid-1990's.

## Stack
- Plain JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- The Almighty Browser

## Building
No Need

## Testing
Test what?

## Contributing
If you have feature suggestions, this project doesn't have features. If you'd like to submit a pull request, I'd suggest you use your time for something more productive.

## Licensing
This project is provided under the `MIT` licence and I hereby grant rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software without limitation, provided the resulting software also carries the same open-source licensing statement. That said, I don't recommend you do any of that; this site is hideous, and the timer function was ganked from StackOverflow.

- [ ] Make styling less appealing
- [ ] More photos of Candle
- [ ] Less photos of me
