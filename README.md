## Overview
In the thick of the 2018 Keto craze, when trendatarians at every table extolled the benefits of not eating carbs, this joke-site was created to preach the virtues of simply eating less, wasting time, and peeping snaps of Candle.

## Demo
[KenoDiet.com](http://www.kenodiet.com/)

## Development Philosophy
My goal in developing this site was to get it up as quickly as possible. It doesn't incorporate any framework or libraries, but rather relies solely on plain [HTML](https://html.com/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). It's hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). In total, around 25 minutes of development time went into its initial creation, testing, and deployment. Since it's a throw-away website, I sought an emphasis on humor, making the color-palette as hideous as possible, with the styling of a Web 1.0 blog from the late-90's (_that's a terrible justification, for an terrible website_).

That said, I don't recommend you do any such thing; this site is hideous, and the timer function was ganked straight from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16156832/javascript-countdown-to-next-real-5-minutes/16157186#16157186).
